## Code of Conduct

We hold our contributors to the highest standard of communication. Racism, sexism, ageism, homophobia, and transphobia will not be tolerated. Any sort of
hate speech, noninclusion, or mean spiritedness will also not be tolerated.

This code of conduct also applies to our Discord community. If you witness any behavior that violates this policy, please reach out to us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/xSmDZGcZjd).

## Getting Started

Contributions are made to this repo via Issues and Pull Requests (PRs). A few general guidelines that cover both:

- To report security vulnerabilities, please use the GitHub [Security Advisory](https://github.com/clockstorm/clockstorm/security/advisories/new) system. You can view
  our entire security policy [here](https://github.com/clockstorm/clockstorm/security/policy).
- Search for existing Issues and PRs before creating your own.

### Issues

Issues should be used to report problems, request a new feature, or to discuss potential changes before a PR is created. When you create a new Issue, a template will be loaded that will guide you through collecting and providing the information we need to investigate.

### Pull Requests

PRs to our libraries are always welcome and can be a quick way to get your fix or improvement slated for the next release. In general, PRs should:

- Only fix/add the functionality in question **OR** address wide-spread whitespace/style issues, not both.
- Add unit or integration tests for fixed or changed functionality (if a test suite already exists).
- Address a single concern in the least number of changed lines as possible.
- Be accompanied by a complete Pull Request template (loaded automatically when a PR is created).

In general, we follow the ["fork-and-pull" Git workflow](https://github.com/susam/gitpr)

1. Fork the repository to your own Github account
2. Clone the project to your machine
3. Create a branch locally with a succinct but descriptive name
4. Commit changes to the branch
5. Following any formatting and testing guidelines specific to this repo
6. Push changes to your fork
7. Open a PR in our repository and follow the PR template so that we can efficiently review the changes.
